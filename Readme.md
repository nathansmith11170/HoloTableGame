# HoloTable

The concept of this game is to have a real time strategy simulation of using a holographic table to command space-faring vessels.

Inspirations:
- EVE Online (combat inspirations, economic simulation)
- X games (primarily X3 and X4, concept of a gate network)
- Kenshi (exploration of ruins, sense of danger everywhere)
- Dwarf Fortress (simulation of personnel)
- FTL (damage model)
- Starsector (2d fleet engagement simulation)

What makes it unique:
- logistics simulation: supply lines!
- simulation scale and performance
- live scripting and debugging (for those so inclined)
- Server Multiplayer model, similar to Avorion or Minecraft

## Build Dependencies
Windows build only, for now
These dependencies should be sourced and placed under third_party
